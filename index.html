                <p> You fell away, what more can I say?
                The feelings evolved, I won't let it out
                I can't replace your screaming face
                Feeling the sickness inside
                Why won't you die?
                Your blood in mine
                We'll be fine
                Then your body will be mine
                So many words can't describe my face
                This feelings evolved, so soon to break out
                I can't relate to a happy state
                Feeling the blood run inside
                Why won't you die?
                Your blood in mine
                We'll be fine
                Then your body will be mine
                Why is everything so fucking hard for me?
                Keep me down to what you think I should be
                Must you tempt me and provoke the ministry?
                Keep on trying, I'm not dying so easily
                I will not die
                (Why is everything so fucking hard for me?)
                I will not die
                (Why is everything so fucking hard for me?)
                I will not die
                Why won't you die?
                Your blood in mine
                We'll be fine
                Then your body will be mine
                Why won't you die?
                Your blood in mine
                We'll be fine
                Then your body will be mine </p>
